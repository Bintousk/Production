# Running on Replit
I set up my Replit so that when you click on the Run button, the web application starts.
The link for the Replit is : https://replit.com/join/jxhbkselip-bintousk
However, you can also do it manually using the following method:
1) Open the console and type ```cd server && npm install && npm start```
2) Open the shell and type ```cd server && npm install && npm start```


# Local deployement
1) Clone this repository by running ```https://github.com/Bintousk/Production.git``` in your terminal.
2) After that open the folder in your IDE and create a split terminal .
3) In on side type ```cd server && npm install && npm start``` and In the other side type ```cd server && npm install && npm start```.
4) Once the application has been installed and is running, you can access the front-end by going to <http://localhost:3000> on your favorite browser.

# Tests
I also implemented some tests.
To run them you have to type ```npm test``` in the server or client file
Ps: To run your tests on the server side you must have your server running on port 5002.
